# terraform-module-cloud-aws-kubernetes-cluster

This Terraform module deploys everything you need in AWS to get a kubernetes cluster up and running. This repo should be used in the context of deploying with an [admiral](https://github.com/glueops/admiral)

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account Setup

1. Create a **new** AWS account underneath your existing AWS Organization
2. Request via AWS Support or your account representative from AWS that they "activate" your account. This can take up to 3 days to finish activating.
3. Once activated, within your sub account create an IAM user/key with "Administrator Access". **No Console access is required for this user.**

4. Pick a region and then set your environment variables in the terminal you will be using for execution. The example below uses `us-west-2`

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

5. Save the `export` statements above in a `.env` file and then source it.

## Terraform Deployment

### Configuration

Create a `captain_configuration.tfvars` configuration file to deploy Kubernetes.
A reasonable starting configuration block:

```hcl
kubernetes_cluster_configurations = {
eks_node_group = {
  "desired_size": 3,
  "instance_types": [
    "t3a.medium"
  ],
  "max_size": 4,
  "min_size": 3
}

vpc_cidr_block = "10.65.0.0/16"

region = "us-west-2"
}
```

You may update `region` if desired.
