# terraform-module-cloud-aws-kubernetes-cluster

This Terraform module deploys everything you need in AWS to get a kubernetes cluster up and running. This repo should be used in the context of deploying with an [admiral](https://github.com/glueops/admiral)

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account Setup

1. Create a **new** AWS account underneath your existing AWS Organization
2. Request via AWS Support or your account representative from AWS that they "activate" your account. This can take up to 3 days to finish activating.
3. Once activated, within your sub account create an IAM user/key with "Administrator Access". **No Console access is required for this user.**

4. Pick a region and then set your environment variables in the terminal you will be using for execution. The example below uses `us-west-2`

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

5. Save the `export` statements above in a `.env` file and then source it.
